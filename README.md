Coding challenge


## Assumptions

1. Currency convertion:

    * The text can vary depending on the reader. A test project was provided with some examples of inputed numbers and expected texts.

2. Robot walking:

    * The cycle is detected when the robot returns to a position where it has been before. That point will be considered the last. And, the next point after the first time it passed in this position will be defined as fist in the cycle.

3. Palindrome:

    * Looking how a palindrome is composed, if the word has an even number of letters, the number of each letter happens in the word will be even, as well. If the number of letters in the word is odd, at most, one letter will happen odd times;
    * There is a test project included.

4. Combination of coins (C++):

    * It is a classic dynamic programming project, so that I used DP aproach to solve the challenge;
    * In Brazil __there is no coins with value 20__. But, it was included in the challenge descriptions, so that I used it.

## Tools

* Visual Studio 2022 - Community Edition
